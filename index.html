        <h2 class="h1">Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img class="bro" src="sike.png" alt="">
        <ol id="olf">
            <li>Increase Data Storage Capacity </li>
            <p>The main thing about the function of this cloud technology is where you can increase data storage
                capacity. This is certainly not without reason because with a cloud storage system you can increase data
                storage capacity.</p>
            <li>Improving Stakeholder Performance</li>
            <p>In a company, of course, there is such a thing as a stakeholder. Stakeholders of course still need to use
                cloud technology for just meeting with clients or also with employees. By using cloud technology, of
                course, this can be done easily and also with its more efficient performance, it can improve its
                performance.</p>
            <li>Get System Updates Periodically (Up to Date)</li>
            <p>Regular system updates are very important. This third function is the advantages and characteristics of
                cloud computing. Where, to overcome the various shortcomings that exist and imitate the development of
                the hottest issues in the era of digital-based technology, the method will continue to update the
                database in a structured manner.</p>
            <li>Private cloud</li>
            <p>In a private cloud, the computing services are offered over a private IT network for the dedicated use of
                a single organization. Also termed internal, enterprise, or corporate cloud, a private cloud is usually
                managed via internal resources and is not accessible to anyone outside the organization.</p>
            <li>Public cloud</li>
            <p>Public cloud refers to computing services offered by third-party providers over the internet. Unlike
                private cloud, the services on public cloud are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them.
                These services could be free or sold on-demand, where users only have to pay per usage for the CPU
                cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.</p>

        <h2 class="h1">Benefits</h2>
        <img class="bro" src="benefits_of_cloud_computing.webp" alt="" id="">
        <!-- Give 10 benefits and description of Cloud Computnig using the ul list you can search how the element works -->
        <ol id="olf">
            <li>Accessibility anywhere, with any device</li>
            <p>each branch or office across various states or countries. The improved accessibility doesn’t just impact
                employees; clients and customers can also log in to an account and access their information as well.
                This ensures everyone has up-to-date information whether they’re at the office or on the go.</p>
            <li>Ability to get rid of most or all hardware and software</li>
            <p>With cloud computing, you’re no longer required to have your own server, cables, network switches, backup
                generators, redundant routers, and so on.</p>
            <li>Centralized data security</li>
            <p>When you use cloud computing, data backups are centralized in the cloud providers' data centers, removing
                the need for individual users or teams to maintain their own backups onsite or offsite. </p>
            <li>Higher performance and availability</li>
            <p>By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously, you reap greater performance gains than by
                having your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing increases input/output operations per second
                (IOPS).</p>
            <li>Quick application deployment</li>
            <p>Unpredictable business needs often require cloud computing resources on short notice. You can improve
                your cloud application development by quickly deploying cloud applications because they are readily
                available without the need to procure additional hardware or wait for IT staff to set up servers.</p>
            <li>Instant business insights</li>
            <p>Cloud-based platforms provide a unique opportunity to access data as soon as it’s collected. This
                facilitates better decision-making as well as insight into what the future may hold for your
                organization based on predictions from historical data.</p>
            <li>Business continuity</li>
            <p>In the event of disaster or unforeseen circumstances, do you have an effective backup plan? If not,
                relying on cloud computing services can benefit your organization. Cloud computing uses infinite data
                storage space and systems that can be activated remotely if necessary to ensure business continuity.</p>
            <li>Price-performance and cost savings</li>
            <p>Although an initial financial investment is required to implement a cloud strategy, organizations save
                substantial amounts in the long run because they don’t have to maintain expensive hardware or local data
                centers. </p>
            <li>Virtualized computing</li>
            <p>Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer environments because cloud resources can be allocated
                instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never experience downtime again. </p>
            <li>Cloud computing is greener</li>
            <p>Cloud computing is a greener technology than traditional IT solutions. By moving to the cloud, businesses
                can reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint by up to 90%.</p>

        <h2 class="h1">Advantages</h2>
        <img class="bro" src="sasas.png" alt="" id="">
        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ol id="olf">
        <li> Immediate Upgrades</li>
        <p>There was a time in the not-so-distant past when companies had to wait for long periods of time to get their software updates. First they came in the mail, courtesy of the U.S. Postal Service. Then they were emailed and required painfully long and inefficient downloading. And next came file sharing, which didn't always work.</p>
        <li>Reduced Cost</li>
        <p>Not that long ago, companies used to have to pay copious amounts of money for bulky servers that took up a lot of space and consumed incredible amounts of energy. Thanks to cloud computing, companies and organizations no longer have to invest in space or energy. Instead, all of their data is stored in the cloud, which doesn't take up any physical space.</p>
        <li> Mobility</li>
        <p>Wherever you go, whenever you need it, the cloud delivers the data and applications you need, provided you are connected to the internet.</p>
        <li> Collaboration</li>
        <p>Ever have an assignment that requires collaboration? Most people, whether for work or school, have. And you have probably had a classmate who just can't be reached.

            Not anymore.
            
            These days, everyone is always accessible; classmates, colleagues, friends, and family.
            
            And you all have access to the same information, thanks to the cloud. There is no longer an excuse for not seeing a document, email, or text that a colleague or classmate has shared with you. This is great news for those looking to put in extra hours and get ahead of the curve.</p>
        <li>Flexibility</li>
        <p>One of the biggest benefits of cloud computing is that it allows you to expand or shrink any strategy or tactic at any time. That can allow your company to make the most of popular promotions and minimize the damage done by those that the public isn't as interested in.

        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ol id="olf">
            <li> Downtime</li>
            <p>Downtime is often cited as one of the biggest cloud computing disadvantages. Since cloud computing systems are internet-based, service outages are always an unfortunate possibility and can occur for any reason.</p>
            <li>Security and privacy</li>
            <p>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards and industry certifications, storing data and important files on external service providers always opens up risks. </p>
            <li>Vulnerability to attack</li>
            <p>Going on with the drawbacks of cloud computing, another one concerns vulnerability: in cloud computing, every component is online, which exposes potential vulnerabilities.</p>
            <li>Limited control and flexibility</li>
            <p>Since the cloud infrastructure is entirely owned, managed, and monitored by the cloud service provider, it transfers minimal control over to the customer.</p>
            <li>Vendor lock-in</li>
            <p>Vendor lock-in is another perceived disadvantage of cloud computing. Easy switching between cloud services is a service that hasn’t yet completely evolved, and organizations may find it difficult to migrate their services from one vendor to another.</p>
